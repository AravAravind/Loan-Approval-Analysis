# Loan Approval Analysis

This repository contains Python code for loan approval analysis. The aim of this project is to predict the approval status of loans using machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and contains information on approximately 900,000 loans.

## Project Overview
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations and statistical analysis are performed to gain insights into the data.
3. Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected based on their impact on loan approval status.
4. Model Development: Machine learning models, including Decision Tree and Random Forest, are built and trained on the dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Predictions: The trained models are used to predict the loan approval status on unseen data.
